## beats-captain-database-project

Database project written in PHP, jQuery, and Bootstrap with an Oracle DB backend.

My team and I first obtained a dataset of 110,001 tuples consisting of Music data from the last 100 years. We input the data into an Oracle Database using the Oracle DBMS at our school. Then, we built a website using PHP, jQuery, and Bootstrap to allow the user to input various search results to be fetched from the database and shown to the user.
